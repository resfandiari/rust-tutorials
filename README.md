# Rust tutorials
My journey to becoming a Rust developer.

## Projects

### hello_world
A simple "Hello, World!" program to get started with Rust.

### variables_and_mutability
Exploring Rust's variable declaration, mutability, constants, and shadowing concepts. Demonstrates:
- Immutable vs mutable variables
- Constants declaration
- Variable shadowing
- Different println! formatting styles

### data_types
Learning about Rust's data types including scalar and compound types. Covers:
- Scalar types (integers, floats, booleans, characters)
- Compound types (tuples, arrays)
- Type annotations and inference

### functions
Understanding Rust functions including parameters, return values, and multiple return values. Demonstrates:
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters with type annotations
- Return values and return types
- Returning multiple values using tuples
### control_flow
Exploring Rust's control flow constructs including conditionals and loops. Demonstrates:
- `if`/`else if`/`else` expressions
- `match` expressions for pattern matching
- `while` loops for iteration
- Recursion vs iterative approaches (factorial example)
